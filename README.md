                                                      VARIABLES

1. Variables in Python
Variables in Python are used to store data values. They are created when you assign a value to them, and you donâ€™t need to declare their type (Python is dynamically typed).

                                      Syntax for Variable Assignment:
                                      x = 5  # Assigning an integer value to the variable x
                                      y = "Hello"  # Assigning a string value to the variable y

Variable Naming Rules:
Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.
Variable names are case-sensitive (Name and name are different).

                               Example:
                               age = 25
                               name = "John"
                               is_student = True
